# PnetPhlix
Movie recommendation system with the ability to provide recommendations for up to 20K movies for up to 100K users. To identify recommended movies for a given person P, the PnetPhlix app determines what attributes are associated with the movies P has watched in the past, and then identifies new movies that also share as many of those attributes as possible. PnetPhlix rank orders movies by 2 the number of common attributes (e.g., if a user tends to watch horror films starring Selena Gomez, then the top recommendations should be horror films with Selena Gomez, followed by perhaps horror films with other actors or non-horror films starring Selena Gomez).
